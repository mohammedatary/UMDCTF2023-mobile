## starting the challenge with installing the apk into our android device 


```bash
    adb install whos_that_pokemon.apk 
```
# when we open the application on the emulator we will find a page with input field and button (GUESS) 
# from the challenge name we can understand that we need to find pokemon name


I prefer to use jadx or jadx-gui to understand the application 

```bash 
    jadx-gui whos_that_pokemon.apk 
```
